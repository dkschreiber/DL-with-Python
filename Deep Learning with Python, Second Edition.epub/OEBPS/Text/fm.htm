  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1011770"></a>If you’ve picked up this book, you’re probably aware of the extraordinary progress that deep learning has represented for the field of artificial intelligence in the recent past. We went from near-unusable computer vision and natural language processing to highly performant systems deployed at scale in products you use every day. The consequences of this sudden progress extend to almost every industry. We’re already applying deep learning to an amazing range of important problems across domains as different as medical imaging, agriculture, autonomous driving, education, disaster prevention, and manufacturing.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1011776"></a>Yet, I believe deep learning is still in its early days. It has only realized a small fraction of its potential so far. Over time, it will make its way to every problem where it can help—a transformation that will take place over multiple decades.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1011782"></a>In order to begin deploying deep learning technology to every problem that it could solve, we need to make it accessible to as many people as possible, including non-experts—people who aren’t researchers or graduate students. For deep learning to reach its full potential, we need to radically democratize it. And today, I believe that we’re at the cusp of a historical transition, where deep learning is moving out of academic labs and the R&amp;D departments of large tech companies to become a ubiquitous part of the toolbox of every developer out there—not unlike the trajectory of web development in the late 1990s. Almost anyone can now build a website or web app for their business or community of a kind that would have required a small team of specialist engineers in 1998. In the not-so-distant future, anyone with an idea and basic coding skills will be able to build smart applications that learn from data.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1011788"></a>When I released the first version of the Keras deep learning framework in March 2015, the democratization of AI wasn’t what I had in mind. I had been doing research in machine learning for several years and had built Keras to help me with my own experiments. But since 2015, hundreds of thousands of newcomers have entered the field of deep learning; many of them picked up Keras as their tool of choice. As I watched scores of smart people use Keras in unexpected, powerful ways, I came to care deeply about the accessibility and democratization of AI. I realized that the further we spread these technologies, the more useful and valuable they become. Accessibility quickly became an explicit goal in the development of Keras, and over a few short years, the Keras developer community has made fantastic achievements on this front. We’ve put deep learning into the hands of hundreds of thousands of people, who in turn are using it to solve problems that were until recently thought to be unsolvable.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1011794"></a>The book you’re holding is another step on the way to making deep learning available to as many people as possible. Keras had always needed a companion course to simultaneously cover the fundamentals of deep learning, deep learning best practices, and Keras usage patterns. In 2016 and 2017, I did my best to produce such a course, which became the first edition of this book, released in December 2017. It quickly became a machine learning best seller that sold over 50,000 copies and was translated into 12 languages.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1011800"></a>However, the field of deep learning advances fast. Since the release of the first edition, many important developments have taken place—the release of TensorFlow 2, the growing popularity of the Transformer architecture, and more. And so, in late 2019, I set out to update my book. I originally thought, quite naively, that it would feature about 50% new content and would end up being roughly the same length as the first edition. In practice, after two years of work, it turned out to be over a third longer, with about 75% novel content. More than a refresh, it is a whole new book.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1011806"></a>I wrote it with a focus on making the concepts behind deep learning, and their implementation, as approachable as possible. Doing so didn’t require me to dumb down anything—I strongly believe that there are no difficult ideas in deep learning. I hope you’ll find this book valuable and that it will enable you to begin building intelligent applications and solve the problems that matter to you.</p>

  <h2 class="fm-head" id="heading_id_10"><a id="pgfId-1014291"></a>about the cover illustration</h2>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1014317"></a>The figure on the cover of <i class="fm-italics">Deep Learning with Python,</i> second edition, is captioned “Habit of a Persian Lady in 1568.” The illustration is taken from Thomas Jefferys’ <i class="fm-italics">A Collection of the Dresses of Different Nations, Ancient and Modern</i> (four volumes), London, published between 1757 and 1772. The title page states that these are hand-colored copperplate engravings, heightened with gum arabic.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1014331"></a>Thomas Jefferys (1719–1771) was called “Geographer to King George III.” He was an English cartographer who was the leading map supplier of his day. He engraved and printed maps for government and other official bodies and produced a wide range of commercial maps and atlases, especially of North America. His work as a map maker sparked an interest in local dress customs of the lands he surveyed and mapped, which are brilliantly displayed in this collection. Fascination with faraway lands and travel for pleasure were relatively new phenomena in the late eighteenth century, and collections such as this one were popular, introducing both the tourist as well as the armchair traveler to the inhabitants of other countries.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1014337"></a>The diversity of the drawings in Jefferys’ volumes speaks vividly of the uniqueness and individuality of the world’s nations some 200 years ago. Dress codes have changed since then, and the diversity by region and country, so rich at the time, has faded away. It’s now often hard to tell the inhabitants of one continent from another. Perhaps, trying to view it optimistically, we’ve traded a cultural and visual diversity for a more varied personal life—or a more varied and interesting intellectual and technical life.</p>

  <p class="body"><a id="pgfId-1014343"></a>At a time when it’s difficult to tell one computer book from another, Manning celebrates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life by Jefferys’ pictures.</p>
